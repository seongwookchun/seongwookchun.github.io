3. Research assistant(short project) : 7/9-AGNR modeling, Pybinding(2018, 2month)
# logical thinking # Python skill # <a href="http://docs.pybinding.site/en/stable/">Pybinding</a>
It is not easy to model 7/9-AGNR only with functions and methods offered by pybinding package.
This 2d material, 7/9-AGNR has a detailed unit cell,
compared to other typical 2d materials like a layer of graphene or a part of it cut into a simple geometry.
To implement the material precisly, it is important not to miss any single atom.
However, the function to cut a layer into a geometry shape misses few dangling atoms, which are not preffered.
I had to look into the inside of the package code and found a solution using simple for loop statement.
I would like to say through this project I well analyze a package and modify with necessity.
Second, introducing a simple perspective is important in that it makes problems easy.
For example, I found a simple view to describe bilayer graphenes in this project.
