Interests : <br>
	NLP: Text generation, Abstractive summarization, Auto labeling on texts, NED<br>
	Web: React, Javascript, NodeJS, Django<br>
Projects :<br>
1. Team project(3 people) : AI cover letter assistant(2 month, 27 Sep ~ 11 Nov 2019)<br>
(A rudimentary study on text generation and abstractive summarization with corpus of cover letters)<br>

2. Study : Derivation of showing equivalence between a model without hidden layers and MLP with linear activation function

3. Research assistant(short project) : 7/9-AGNR modeling, Pybinding(2018, 2 months)
# logical thinking # Python skill # <a href="http://docs.pybinding.site/en/stable/">Pybinding</a>
<br>
It is not easy to model 7/9-AGNR only with functions and methods offered by pybinding package.
This 2d material, 7/9-AGNR has a detailed unit cell,
compared to other typical 2d materials like a layer of graphene or a part of it cut into a simple geometry.
To implement the material precisly, it is important not to miss any single atom.
However, the function to cut a layer into a geometry shape misses few dangling atoms, which are not preffered.
I had to look into the inside of the package code and found a solution using simple for loop statement.
I would like to say through this project I well analyze a package and modify with necessity.
Second, introducing a simple perspective is important in that it makes problems easy.
For example, I found a simple view to describe bilayer graphenes in this project.

	4. Key value library benchmark(basics of key value library, installation with proper version)
	(started from March 2020, 1 month)
	The object is to find out which key value library is fastest on set and put operations and compare with BerkeleyDB.
	Although there are many open source key value stores, RocksDB, Memcached, Redis are chosen aside with BerkeleyDB.
	I learned basic concepts: <br>
	CAP theorem, probabilistic data structure(Bloom filter), and in-memory kv store, on-disk kv store, embedded kv store.

5. Attempt to convert NED engine into Korean(Java, PostgreSQL)
(started from April 2020, 1 month)
I tried to make a variation of a NED engine into Korean.
The NED engine is proposed by an article, Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text(2011, J Hoffart, et al.)
This is a project written in Java language. I focused on data structure required by the NED engine in order to fit a new language to it.
Although trying to avoid spending time to understand details of the mechanism and theories of NED, the basics are required to some extent.
I insist that by conducting this project my abilities is improved:
1. to search on stackoverflow and etc. to tackle whatever issues 
2. to install applications of proper version which is compatible with the project on Ubuntu, CentOS
3. to write installation docs and documentations which reproduce and resolve issues

6. Model training data engineering webtool(Django, JQuery, React)
(started from May 2020, for 2 months)
I made a webtool of proto type version which offers more work efficiency for engineering training data for a NED model than previous manner.
The NED model decides a specific named entity from each mentions in sentences by scoring from neighboring words as its context.
Engineering is a human process to correct the dictionary which stores information of words giving scores to certain mention.
The previous manner is conducted by linux terminal, vim editor. It is okay only for people who are computer developer or have ability to handle basic linux.
The need was occured to make web tool which enables this engineering process also to be done by people who are not familiary with linux.
