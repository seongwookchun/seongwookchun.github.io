Here, mostly theories and trials of solving problems in NLP are treated.

Projects :<br>
1. Team project(3 people) : AI cover letter assistant(2 month, 27 Sep ~ 11 Nov 2019)<br>
(A rudimentary study on text generation and abstractive summarization with corpus of cover letters)<br>

3. Research assistant(short project) : 7/9-AGNR modeling, Pybinding(2018, 2 months)
# logical thinking # Python skill # <a href="http://docs.pybinding.site/en/stable/">Pybinding</a>
<br>
It is not easy to model 7/9-AGNR only with functions and methods offered by pybinding package.
This 2d material, 7/9-AGNR has a detailed unit cell,
compared to other typical 2d materials like a layer of graphene or a part of it cut into a simple geometry.
To implement the material precisly, it is important not to miss any single atom.
However, the function to cut a layer into a geometry shape misses few dangling atoms, which are not preffered.
I had to look into the inside of the package code and found a solution using simple for loop statement.
I would like to say through this project I well analyze a package and modify with necessity.
Second, introducing a simple perspective is important in that it makes problems easy.
For example, I found a simple view to describe bilayer graphenes in this project.

4. Model training data engineering webtool(Django, JQuery, React)
(started from May 2020, for 2 months)
I made a webtool which offers more efficiency for engineering training data for a NED model than previous methodology.
The NED model decides a specific named entity from each mentions in sentences by scoring from neighboring words as its context.

5. Attempt to convert NED engine into Korean(Java, PostgreSQL)
(started from April 2020, 1 month)
I tried to make a variation of a NED engine into Korean.
The NED engine is proposed by an article, Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text(2011, J Hoffart, et al.)
This is a project written in Java language. I focused on data structure required by the NED engine in order to fit a new language to it.
Although trying to avoid spending time to understand details of the mechanism and theories of NED, the basics are required to some extent.
I insist that by conducting this project my abilities is improved:
1. to search on stackoverflow and etc. to tackle whatever issues 
2. to install applications of proper version which is compatible with the project on Ubuntu, CentOS
3. to write installation docs and documentations which reproduce and resolve issues
