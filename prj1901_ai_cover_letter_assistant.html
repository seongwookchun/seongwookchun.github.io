<h3>Abstract</h3>
Concept of the project: <br>
These days, job seekers make a lot of efforts and spend their time to get fine jobs.
Although hiring processes are different by companies and such as document screening, aptitude test, interview, and group discussion and each steps are important to pass to the next step, however, the most important thing and the thing that shows who they are and how they are aptitude to requirements of promising roles is cover letter. We planned this project to support for writing cover letters easily by offering three main functions.<br><br>
<li>Synonym recommendation</li>
<li>Auto-completion of sentence</li>
<li>Title recommendation</li>
<br>
Technics: word2vec, LSTM, seq2seq, BERT(classification)<br>

Conclusions: The synonym recommendation of word2vec model does not always shows synonyms. The word2vec model returns with some keywords such as "antonyms rather than synonyms<br>
